      content: "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) lets smart contracts compute on encrypted data without ever seeing the plaintext. You encrypt inputs locally, the contract receives only ciphertexts, runs FHE ops, and you (or allowed parties) and the network‚Äôs KMS (permitted by your ACL) returns the plaintext to the client. No app backend needs to be trusted. decrypt the result off-chain. This brings privacy to public blockchains without trusting a server.",

In computeSum, FHE.add(_a, _b) adds ciphertexts directly - no decryption happens on-chain. The contract never learns the real numbers; it only manipulates encrypted values. Note: euint8/euint32 arithmetic is modular (wrap-around).",
